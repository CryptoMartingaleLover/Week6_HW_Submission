# Week6_HW_Submission
Welcome to my Week 6 PyViz homework submission. There are two parts to this homework - the rental_analysis.ipynb and the dashboard.ipynb.

The meat'n'potatoes of the assignment is the dashboard.ipynb file. It's great if you'd like to look at all the code that got us there, but the visualizations which are the whole point of the exercise can be found on code line 77, after the heading "Serve the Panel Dashboard". 

It is fairly self-explanatory on how to use the dashboard, but please note that one item has a drop-down menu and two others have tabs that you can interact with. Some of the graphs also react to the cursor hovering over data points. Thank you again, and enjoy!
